      <h3>Academic Experience</h3>
      <p>I was introduced to the concepts of Data Structures at Christopher Newport University as a computer science student in CPSC 320. While I was already aware of primitives and simpler abstract data types, it was in this class that I learned of more complex data structures, such as linked lists, binary trees and graphs, as well as the benefits of using data structures for efficiency and reduction of maintenance. Also, since most of my programming assignments were completed in C++ at the time, I became aware of the importance of memory management when dealing with collections and associations. Looking back, this course laid the foundations for much of what I do today.</p></br>
      <p>I received an A (12 credit hours) for CPSC 320.</p>

      <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
      <p>In my career as a web and mobile software engineer, I use data structures nearly every day. For instance, when developing in Objective-C for iOS, I commonly use the complex data structures <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/cocoa/conceptual/collections/Collections.html" target="blank">provided by Cocoa</a>; and in my Java based applications, I routinely make use of parameterized typed data structures, which uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generics_in_Java" target="blank">generics</a> to type-check at compile time.</p></br> 
      <p>I also understand the importance of creating object classes. Extending basic data structures into objects has been invaluable when working on large-scale applications, and utilizing object-oriented techniques, such as abstraction, has allowed me to manage all levels of interactions in a program, regardless the complexity.</p></br>
      <p>The work sample below demonstrates my knowledge of primitive types and complex data structures &mdash; it is a simple java class which consumes several xml files with time zone information and parses the content into various data types and structures including: primitives, arrays, maps and enumerators.</p></br>

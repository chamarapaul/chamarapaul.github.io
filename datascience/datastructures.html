      <h3>Academic Experience</h3>
      <p>I was introduced to the concept of Data Structures at Christopher Newport University, via CPSC 320. While I was already aware of primative and abstract data types, it was in this class that I learned benefits of using correct data types for efficiency, performance and reduction of maintenance. Since most of my programming assignments were completed in C++ at the time, I also learned of the importance of memory management when dealing with non-primative types. Looking back, this course on data structures laid the foundation for much of what I do today.</p></br>
      <p>I received an A (12 credit hours) for CPSC 320.</p>

      <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
      <p>In my career as a web and mobile software engineer, not only do I use and modify various data structures on a daily basis, but I also understand the importance of creating object classes as well. Extending basic data structures into objects has been invaluable in creating large-scale applications; and abstraction of the many into the whole has allowed me to manage interactions of a program, no matter how complex.</p></br>
      <p>Without understanding data structures, I could not do the work that I do today.</p>

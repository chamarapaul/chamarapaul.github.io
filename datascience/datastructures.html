      <h3>Academic Experience</h3>
      <p>I was introduced to the concept of Data Structures at Christopher Newport University, via CPSC 320. While I was already aware of primative and simpler abstract data types, it was in this class that I learned benefits of using correct data types for efficiency, performance and reduction of maintenance. I was also introduced to more complex data types such as linked lists, binary trees and graphs; and, since most of my programming assignments were completed in C++ at the time, I learned of the importance of memory management when dealing with non-primative data types. Looking back, this course on data structures laid the foundation for much of what I do today.</p></br>
      <p>I received an A (12 credit hours) for CPSC 320.</p>

      <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
      <p>In my career as a web and mobile software engineer, I use data structures nearly every day. When developing in Objective-C, I commonly use the complex data structures <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/cocoa/conceptual/collections/Collections.html" target="blank">provided by Cocoa</a>; and in Java, I routinely use parameterized typed data structures, which uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generics_in_Java" target="blank">generics</a> to type-check data structures at compile time.</p></br>
      <p>I also understand the importance of creating object classes as well. Extending basic data structures into objects has been invaluable when working on large-scale applications; and abstraction of the many into the whole has allowed me to manage interactions of a program, no matter how complex.</p></br>
